<center>I graduated from BITS Pilani K. K. Birla Goa campus with dual degrees of M.Sc. (Hons.) in Economics and B.E. (Hons.) in Chemical Engineering. I am currently working in JP Morgan Chase & Co.,India , in the Robotics Process Automation team.</n>I am interested in investment banking, financial modelling and stock pitches. I like to analyse ideas that would help further breakdown and understand the client's problems.</center>
